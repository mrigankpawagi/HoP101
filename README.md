# HoP101: Hands-on Python 101

HoP101 is an experimental course on computational thinking and programming, with Python as a primary tool. It is designed to provide audience without prior computer science exposure an experience into what problem solving through programming is like. There is a huge emphasis on providing a discovery-led experience, so that learners can develop intuition in the process of programming. Unlike traditional programming tutorials, HoP101 follows an application-based approach in order to not only allow people from non-CS backgrounds develop an interest in computing, but also to allow learners to relate to the material better and develop confidence in solving real-world problems through computing. HoP101 is not an exhaustive course yet, and is rather meant to provide an introduction that can supplement other courses that learners take up later on. This is a work in progress, and feedback will be highly appreciated.
